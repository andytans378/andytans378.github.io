								<h1>Andreas Tan</h1>
								<p> Name: Andreas Tan.
Student number: s3783442.
Email: s3783442@student.rmit.edu.au
 I, along with my other fellow kind define ourselves as Chindos. We are Chinese Indonesians where our family migrated and currently comes from Indonesia, but we are of Chinese descent. In the past I have completed VCE through the normal 13 years of schooling here in Australia. I started primary school in St. Catherine’s where I then completed high school certificate within Beaconhills College and Salesian College. I am now currently in my first year of university, studying a bachelor or I.T. at RMIT. I can speak 2 languages fluently; Indonesian and English, however I can also understand basic phrases in Chinese and French. Although I am studying an I.T course, It was never my plan to put the courses in my preference list.

								<h2 class="major">Interest in I.T</h2>
								<p>My interest in I.T sparked as I begun this course. Originally, I had planned to study business, but somehow I.T had found its way into my preference list on VTAC. As I begun my studies I found the course quite intriguing as I begun to understand how the technology in today’s world operates. Now I have a new found hobby in trying different codes and seeing how they react with each other. There isn’t one person that sparked this interest, but rather a group of people who are my friends and family. My father has a background in I.T and taught me a little bit about coding. Whether it be small things like getting a console to print a line or something bigger like building a computer. I find it interesting how this all comes together. My friends also helped as we built various computers together for us to game together ranging from an overclocked build priced over $4k to a simple bare motherboard with a fan for $800. With little to no I.T experience I found it very hard coming into this course. The most I.t. Experience was when me and my friends attempted to hack the school laptops to negate the school profile that was installed. I also have experience with building computers but too be honest, I barely understand what all the components do.

I didn’t originally plan to come to RMIT, but somehow within all my preferences set for Monash, RMIT found its way as my third preference. I had thought many times if I should attempt to get a Monash offer for second round however after attending a few open days of Monash, RMIT and Melb Uni I decided that RMIT was best equipped for the I.T course. It wasn’t till later that I found out 5 of my school friends had also been offered an I.T course at RMIT which locked in my decision to attend RMIT.
I still hope that I can move towards a business orientated study, where I could end up as something like a I.T administrator or a business analyst. So what I’m hoping to learn from my studies is sufficient I.T knowledge to be able to thrive in the types of jobs that I have listed above. Although I feel like I.T will not be enough I am hoping to do my best in this course and understand to the best of my ability how computer language works and what a computer and other devices work with each of their components.

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IdealJob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job as an Information & Communication Technology Manager finds the employee responsible for multiple I.T teams. The employee is also required to be able to have communication skills to be able to work with business leaders and to grow the I.T teams. The skills required for this job are strong communication skills to be able to deal with stakeholders and assess what is needed technology wise. Communication skills are also needed to clearly discuss with your I.T teams to manage projects as well as to develop cohesiveness and relationships within the teams. Strong I.T knowledge is also needed as the employee is responsible to come up with quick technological solutions whilst withstanding a certain quality. From these skills, the qualifications and experience that can be derived include background in dealing with potential high-grade customers in a professional manner. It also requires a strong background in being able to manage a team whilst also completing own work. Lastly the employee will need an I.T qualification to prove that they are able to complete the I.T requirements for the company. At this state my current qualification and experience is insufficient. Having only started a bachelor of I.T course, along with very little computer knowledge, I do not have sufficient skills to be considered for this job. I also have not completed any formal qualification that benefit me in this job. With little to no experience in managing people or working in a large business, My skills, qualifications and experience have a lot of room to grow before I am capable enough for this job. My plan to work towards this job requires me to complete a degree in I.T as well as develop my skills in management from other smaller companies before I can work to manage whole teams. I also need learn how to converse with stakeholders to allow me to close deals and tailor to their needs.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<p>The Myer-Briggs test resulted in my personality type being virtuoso.
To be virtuoso means to be highly skilled in music and art components.
The results of this test can be applied to me somewhat, but I believe that it is not a true indication of my personality. I am skilled in the music department; however I am not a highly creative person that has the desire to pursue arts. These results may influence my behaviour in a team as, if I stay true to being a virtuoso, I can bring fresh ideas to the team and describe creative ways to accomplish a task. When forming a team, a virtuoso should be a part of the creative design for team projects. By knowing this, I should use my skills to work on team projects in my creative area.
