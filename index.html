 								<p>I, along with my other fellow kind define ourselves as Chindos. We are Chinese Indonesians where our family migrated and currently comes from Indonesia, but we are of Chinese descent. In the past I have completed VCE through the normal 13 years of schooling here in Australia. I started primary school in St. Catherine’s where I then completed high school certificate within Beaconhills College and Salesian College. I am now currently in my first year of university, studying a bachelor or I.T. at RMIT. I can speak 2 languages fluently; Indonesian and English, however I can also understand basic phrases in Chinese and French. Although I am studying an I.T course, It was never my plan to put the courses in my preference list.<p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in I.T</h2>
								<p>My interest in I.T sparked as I begun this course. Originally, I had planned to study business, but somehow I.T had found its way into my preference list on VTAC. As I begun my studies I found the course quite intriguing as I begun to understand how the technology in today’s world operates. Now I have a new found hobby in trying different codes and seeing how they react with each other. There isn’t one person that sparked this interest, but rather a group of people who are my friends and family. My father has a background in I.T and taught me a little bit about coding. Whether it be small things like getting a console to print a line or something bigger like building a computer. I find it interesting how this all comes together. My friends also helped as we built various computers together for us to game together ranging from an overclocked build priced over $4k to a simple bare motherboard with a fan for $800. With little to no I.T experience I found it very hard coming into this course. The most I.t. Experience was when me and my friends attempted to hack the school laptops to negate the school profile that was installed. I also have experience with building computers but too be honest, I barely understand what all the components do.

I didn’t originally plan to come to RMIT, but somehow within all my preferences set for Monash, RMIT found its way as my third preference. I had thought many times if I should attempt to get a Monash offer for second round however after attending a few open days of Monash, RMIT and Melb Uni I decided that RMIT was best equipped for the I.T course. It wasn’t till later that I found out 5 of my school friends had also been offered an I.T course at RMIT which locked in my decision to attend RMIT.
I still hope that I can move towards a business orientated study, where I could end up as something like a I.T administrator or a business analyst. So what I’m hoping to learn from my studies is sufficient I.T knowledge to be able to thrive in the types of jobs that I have listed above. Although I feel like I.T will not be enough I am hoping to do my best in this course and understand to the best of my ability how computer language works and what a computer and other devices work with each of their components.

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IdealJob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job as an Information & Communication Technology Manager finds the employee responsible for multiple I.T teams. The employee is also required to be able to have communication skills to be able to work with business leaders and to grow the I.T teams. The skills required for this job are strong communication skills to be able to deal with stakeholders and assess what is needed technology wise. Communication skills are also needed to clearly discuss with your I.T teams to manage projects as well as to develop cohesiveness and relationships within the teams. Strong I.T knowledge is also needed as the employee is responsible to come up with quick technological solutions whilst withstanding a certain quality. From these skills, the qualifications and experience that can be derived include background in dealing with potential high-grade customers in a professional manner. It also requires a strong background in being able to manage a team whilst also completing own work. Lastly the employee will need an I.T qualification to prove that they are able to complete the I.T requirements for the company. At this state my current qualification and experience is insufficient. Having only started a bachelor of I.T course, along with very little computer knowledge, I do not have sufficient skills to be considered for this job. I also have not completed any formal qualification that benefit me in this job. With little to no experience in managing people or working in a large business, My skills, qualifications and experience have a lot of room to grow before I am capable enough for this job. My plan to work towards this job requires me to complete a degree in I.T as well as develop my skills in management from other smaller companies before I can work to manage whole teams. I also need learn how to converse with stakeholders to allow me to close deals and tailor to their needs.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<p>The Myer-Briggs test resulted in my personality type being virtuoso.
To be virtuoso means to be highly skilled in music and art components.
The results of this test can be applied to me somewhat, but I believe that it is not a true indication of my personality. I am skilled in the music department; however I am not a highly creative person that has the desire to pursue arts. These results may influence my behaviour in a team as, if I stay true to being a virtuoso, I can bring fresh ideas to the team and describe creative ways to accomplish a task. When forming a team, a virtuoso should be a part of the creative design for team projects. By knowing this, I should use my skills to work on team projects in my creative area. Below is the results from the Myer-Briggs test.</p
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The learning Style Test resulted in my learning style being tactile/kinaesthetic.
To be a tactile/kinaesthetic learner means that I learn best with my hands by working on things and touching them. Also by taking things apart and overall getting a feel for things.
I find this very true about myself as I do find that if I am simply watching or listening to instructions, I don’t have a good grasp of what is needed. Rather I find myself benefitting the most out of a lesson if I am able to try things out in different ways for myself to find my own way or understand how people do it by trying myself. These results should influence my behaviour in a team as most training or briefings only allow information to be absorbed by listening. I have to adapt to allow more time for me to figure things out as I have to try tasks myself multiple times before I have a real grasp of what is required for the job. This should be taken into account as I can influence deadlines and other time management stuff as I generally work slower. </p>
								<p>The Big Five personality test returned results as seen in image below
Overall, I find these results quite reflective of my personality. That could have something to do with factor 3. They reflect brilliantly how I am quite an introverted person that finds myself agreeing with a lot of things because I’m worried how other people may feel. This can influence my behaviour in a team as I will not give myself much opportunity to allow my ideas to be heard, but rather I will simply agree with the idea I find most interesting or best fit for the job. This should be taken into account when forming a team as I would prefer to follow rather than lead. If the leader of the team has a plan I will follow what is required of me. Test results are seen below</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
<p>My project idea is basically a contact lens that anybody can wear that allows the user to have a user interface in reality. In other words the user will have an interface over the real world allowing them to access things such as google maps, time, calendar, reminders and so many more apps and widgets without looking at their phone. I mean just think about it, the government is currently working on stopping people from using their phones on the road, but if notifications and maps were apart of their vision, drivers would not have to look down at their phones to look at the map or see who is calling them. Rather it will come up in their prereferral vision whilst driving.
This project is especially appealing to me as I have seen it in a number of different movies where users are able to see a virtual reality when they put on these lenses. In the Korean drama, Memories of Alhambra, the protagonist find himself in charge of contact lenses that immerses himself into a kind of virtual reality game where the game world is the real world. I found this idea quite intriguing the first time I saw it, so I figured a good project idea would be a contact lens that could be applied to our daily lives to help us in different ways.
The contact lenses will be sold in a case that contains a jellylike substance that retains moisture in the lens. When the lens is placed on the eyes like any normal contact lens. The lens will then detect the user by doing a retina scan to verify identity. The lens will then open up this futuristic display that can only be seen by the user due to the lens. From this display the user can select things and move thigs around by moving their hands in front of their eyes, like a tablet. The lens will scan the movement and adjust the interface accordingly. The user will have access to applications such as google maps and new virtual reality games that are supported on their phone’s platform. They will also have access to widgets that they can customize on their interface using their hands. Due to the unique way the lens work, each user can create an interface according to their likes and needs. Applications and widgets can be kept open whilst moving about to help users in their day to day life. These applications will also work with Siri or Cortana or the equivalent AI that their phone’s platform supports. Therefore on the day to day bases, users will be able to have functions such as google maps in front of them, be able to see notifications such as texts or who is currently calling them; due to the unique hand movements that can be scanned using the lens, users will also have complete control over these functions allowing them to accept and hang up on phone calls, move the map around to be able to see their surroundings. This is only the beginning of the potential that’s these lens’ can allow. With this revolutionary piece of technology, we can erase hazards such as drivers on their phones and pedestrians on their phones. Furthermore, this technology can be the start of a new revolution. Being an apple fanatic, I will work to have this new technology support apple products. The user interface will be able to be linked with devices such as air pods, iPhone’s, apple watches and apple home to allow for control from the user interface. Functions such as being able to skip music, pause and control volume; functions which the air pods are missing alone, will be possible with these lenses. When needed the user will be able to turn off the interface to show normal vision of the standard real world. This will allow full control over the interface to stop distractions when needed. These lenses will also be able to come with a prescription with special order allowing people with imperfect vision to utilise contact lenses with this new technology. These require special order the lens will have to be adjusted to suit the prescription of the user. This allows any person to be able to find the right lenses for them. Other functions allow the user to customise colour preference of interface as well as different themes that can be downloaded into the lens. You can connect the lens to an external device such as a laptop to upload themes and other widgets via usb type c, that will allow  for <p>
